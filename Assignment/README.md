# Lab 1
## Objective
To familiarize yourself with Github and Code Composer. Further, to create a math.c and math.h file that can be implemented
in a UART Calculator Code
## How
In order to implement the math functions depending on the operator, a switch statemnt was used where each case was a 
seperate operator. Inside the case the logic for the math behind that operator were written. A math.h file was not required.
